ERA5:

    ECMWF's latest reanalysis dataset, ERA5 currently spans from 1979 to present day, with
    plans to extend back to 1950.  However, it must be noted that due to the lack of
    satellite data before 1979 that the reliability of ERA5 reanalysis data drastically
    decreases before 1979.  Therefore, unless otherwise specified, ClimateERA.jl will by
    default download data only from 1979 onwards.

    To select this module in erastartup, use:
        - erastartup(dID=1)


ERA-Interim:

    As the name suggests, ERA-Interim was designed to be an interim reanalysis dataset that
    bridges ERA40 and ERA5, from 1979 to 2019.  However, due to the fact that ECMWF did not
    produce a full-year dataset for 2019, ClimateERA.jl will not download 2019 data.

    To select this module in erastartup, use:
        - erastartup(dID=2)


Note: If you are interested in collaborating to add other ECMWF datasets (or even other
reanalysis datasets) to this feature, please contact me (Nathanael), and/or create a pull
request / issue.
